  ## Description 
  
  Budget-Tracker is exactly what it sounds like. It is an application that allows a user to track their expenses simply. It is ideal for a traveller not only because transactions can be done with the click of a button, but the apllication can even be used offline! Budget-tracker is an express application that uses IndexedDB to allow offline transactions. Additionally, Budget-Tracker has been converted to a PWA, so it can be downloaded as an app on your favorite mobile-device. All of the changes that are made to your budget offline are stored with IndexedDB so you can maintain a working total. As soon as the user connects back to the internet all of their offline changes are updated.
